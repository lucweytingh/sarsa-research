* Setup

Make sure =conda= is installed. Then, create the =sarsa_research= conda
environment. From the root directory of the project, run the following
command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
conda env create --file=environment.yml
#+END_SRC

Then, in this environment, install =src= as an editable package by running:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
conda activate sarsa_research
pip install -e .
#+END_SRC

or, if you need to update the environment, run this when the environment is active:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
conda env update --file environment.yml  --prune
#+END_SRC



** .env
Add a =.env= in the root of the project directory and set the following
parameters:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
PROJECT_DIR=/path/to/this/project/
#+END_SRC
