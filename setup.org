* Posed questions
** What environment(s) should you test your technique(s) on?
Discrete environments that could relatively be discretized, such as https://gym.openai.com/envs/#toy_text
** What methods should you compare the chosen technique to?
SARA vs. expected SARSA
** What hyperparameters should you set? How to ensure comparisons are fair with regard to the hyperparameters?
The learning rate $\alpha$ and the discount factor $\gamma$. We will set the
discount_factor to the same value in both algorithms. We will use grid search
to find the optimal learning rate for both algorithms, and set the learning
rate to the optimal values for each respective algorithm.
** Which quantities do you need to measure?
Compute time and sample efficiency, i.e. the number of samples needed for
convergence.
** How many random runs do you need?
For a particular algorithm, a particular task we would like to measure our
desired quantities using 10 different random seeds.
* What we need
Scripts that generates:
- an =environment2algorithm2optimal_learning_rate=
- an =environment2algorithm2avg_samples_used= and
  =environment2algorithm2convergence_steps=
